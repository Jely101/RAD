# RAD
This reposistory will be used as the basis for all code and document used for the RAD project.
There is a project view which will be used to help keep track of the required tasks, and their progress/completion status, so please make sure to update the Project tab when a task is being undertaken, or has been completed.
it is intended that we will set up a group chat via messenger to help keep track of the application's progress.
included is a copy of the movie search website we will be using as a basis for this project.
Included in the Movies_Search file is a movies.sql file that will create a database(movies_db), a table (movies_table) and populate the table will all the data entries in order to make the website function correctly. 
please use the document template for any reports written, and once a report has been completed, add it to the master document under the appropriate heading. this will ensure that the same document format is used throughout the entire RAD project.
